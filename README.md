  <h1>Jamboree26 Auth Demo Client</h1>
</div>

This is an application that demonstrates how the authentication helper service
works and can be integrated.

The code isn't very well written and most of it is in a single file, but I
mostly wrote it for myself to try out some concepts. I might rewrite it down the
line so that it can be used as an implementation example.

## Running it

Install the dependencies
```sh
pnpm install
```

Run the application
```sh
pnpm run dev
```

Try it out on `https://localhost:3000`
